# 1. Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch
byFacebook AI

Use PyTorch to implement your first deep neural network

In this course, you’ll learn the basics of deep learning, and build your own deep neural networks using PyTorch. 

You’ll get practical experience with PyTorch through coding exercises and projects implementing state-of-the-art AI applications such as style transfer and text generation.
